Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

DriverPass is an online learning tool for those working toward getting their drivers liscense. The application allowed the user/student to create and account, log in, and select one of three packages (a bundle of teaching tools and lessons) to get them ready for the test at the DMV, as well as presents them with a "dashboard" where they can keep up on the instructors notes and see overall progress. 

What did you do particularly well?

I feel this course presented many interesting new ideas, as well as many things learned in previous classes, which was a pleasent refresher. But of all the things done throughout this course, and more specifically, the projects, the diagrams stand out. In doing them, I was better able to understand how the DriverPass system was supposed to work, rather than simply reading about it in prompts.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

In the business design doc, we were supposed to list limitations, along with many other bullet points to inform the owner of the inner workings of the system during our presentation meeting. And I feel I could have done better in this area. The few I gave are fine, but I feel more time and thought could have been put into this section, to return better results.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

Without the user's needs plainly spelled out, we would have made an application that most would not use, and if they did, it might be confusing/ unefficient. Taking into account all the information gathered from the meeting transcript from owner and some of the development team, I was able to grasp most of what the user would be looking at when they logged in, as well as the objects and things they would be interacting with. In the real world, we'd have testers come and try the app. And from their feed back, we would be able to refine the project even more. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I think recording what the owner wants from the project, and then taking that data and organizing it would be step one. And as I said before, seeing the porject laid out in multiple different diagrams really gave me a better understanding of how it was all supposed to work. That would be step two. Lastly, working in modules, completing smaller sections, building from the floor up, is something I really try to stress to myself. Starting my journey with development, I tried doing everything, all at once, and upon compile...well, I'm sure you could guess the outcome. Little steps toward progress, that's the better way.
